# Lincon
Lincon is a dark HexChat theme, based on an unknown theme, I found about 10 years ago. Customizations were made inspired by default linux console colors and irssi. Constantly updating through years it evolved into Lincon.

Lincon theme includes both color scheme and custom events updated to HexChat v2.10.2.
